## Code of Conduct

This project and all its contributors are governed by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/xkrishguptaa/bot-dc-htm/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By taking part in this project, you are expected to uphold this code. If you find unacceptable behavior, report it to xkrishguptaa@gmail.com.

## I have a Question

If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/xkrishguptaa/bot-dc-htm/blob/main/README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/xkrishguptaa/bot-dc-htm/issues) that might help you. In case you found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in the issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/xkrishguptaa/bot-dc-htm/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions, depending on what seems relevant.

We will take care of the issue as soon as possible

## How can I Contribute?

### Legal Notice 
**When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content and that the content you contribute may be provided under the project license.**

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for HackTheMountains Discord Bot. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report 📝, reproduce the behaviour 🖥️, and find related reports 🔍.

> Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Submitting A Good Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. 

Please make sure the following in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue that clearly identifies the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem in detail**.
Include information on how you initiated the issue, such as the specific command used or the method followed.
Explain the method used, whether it's via mouse clicks, keyboard shortcuts, or other actions, and specify which ones.
- **Offer specific examples** like links to relevant files or projects, or code snippets that illustrate the issue.
- **Detail what behavior you observed after following the steps** and clearly identify the problem within that behavior.
- **Explain the behavior you expected to see instead and provide the reasoning behind your expectation.**
- **Enhance your report with screenshots or animated GIFs** that visually demonstrate the problem as you follow the described steps.
- **If the issue wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem occurred and provide any relevant additional information.**

Once it's done:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be implemented by someone.


### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for the project, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.** Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions 🔍.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- **Check if the functionality is already covered**.
- **Perform a [search](https://github.com/xkrishguptaa/bot-dc-htm/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.** If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- **Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.** It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. 

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

**Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/xkrishguptaa/bot-dc-htm/issues)**. If you want to submit an enhancement suggestion, create an issue on the repository and provide the following information:

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. You may include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. 
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most of the users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

### Your First Code Contribution 🎊

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` or `good first issue` labeled issues:

- Beginner Issues are very simple issues and require very less work.
- Help Wanted Issues are a bit more involved.
- `good first issue` - labeled issues maybe any type of issues.

### Improving the Documentation 📄

Documentation is a crucial part of our project. Clear and well-maintained documentation helps all contributors and users understand how our project works. If you'd like to contribute to our documentation, we welcome your help! Here's how you can do it:

#### 1. Identify Documentation Needs

Before you start, it's essential to identify areas of our documentation that need improvement or expansion. Here are some ways you can do this:

- **Review the existing documentation** and look for outdated information, unclear explanations, or missing sections.
- **Pay attention to questions and issues raised by users or contributors**. If they are struggling with understanding a part of our project, it might be a documentation issue.

#### 2. Create an Issue

To suggest a documentation improvement or report an issue, create a new GitHub issue. Please follow these guidelines when creating a documentation-related issue:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** that reflects the issue or improvement you're suggesting.
- **Provide detailed information about the problem or the proposed change**. Include any relevant context or examples.
- **Label the issue with the 'documentation' label** to help us identify it easily.

#### 3. Make Changes

If you're interested in making the changes yourself, you can follow these steps:

- Fork our repository to your GitHub account.
- Create a new branch for your documentation changes.
- Make the necessary updates or additions to the documentation.
- Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
- Push your changes to your forked repository.
- Create a pull request (PR) to propose your changes.

#### 4. Review and Collaboration

Once you've created a PR, our maintainers will review it. Be prepared for feedback and revisions. We may ask for clarifications or suggest improvements.

#### 5. Acknowledgment

We greatly appreciate your contributions to our documentation! You'll be acknowledged as a contributor in our project's acknowledgments or contributors' list.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward making this project better.
- Enable a sustainable system for the maintainers to review contributions.

To submit a better Pull Request, follow these:

1. If applicable, use appropriate templates for the Pull Requests.
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing 
<details>
<summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>
    If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.
</details>
